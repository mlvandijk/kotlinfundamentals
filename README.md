## Programming with types

### Interfaces
Kotlin has interfaces, which are fairly similar to those in Java.
Declared with the keyword `interface`.
Use the `override` keyword to override a function from the interface.

By default everything is public: classes, interfaces, functions.

### Classes
`final` by default.
`abstract` classes
modifiers
sealed classes
constructors
data classes

To make it possible to extend a class, open the class using the `open` keyword.
